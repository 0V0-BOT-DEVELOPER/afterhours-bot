This is obviously a buggy mess but yeah... I don't have anything else to add sorry.
I'll add a setup api when I can but at the moment all you need to do is check the config
and keys file. Paste the keys in this order:
api key
api secret
api access token
api secret token
It should work from there.
Also thank you to Saucecode for the open source reddit ripper.
